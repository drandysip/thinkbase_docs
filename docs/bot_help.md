Bot Help
======

This bot runs in two modes: The interactive mode you are in now, and a guided mode when it is running through a ruleset.

To see all the rulesets you can run type:

_run ruleset_

Rulesets can be very long depending on what they need to achieve.
You can quit a ruleset by typing:

_quit_ 

or any other English word meaning the same thing.

You can go back to the previous questions within a ruleset to change an answer by typing:

_back_

or any English word meaning the same thing, repeatedly.
