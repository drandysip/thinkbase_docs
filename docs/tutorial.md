Tutorial
===
This will show you how to get a Bot running in minutes using our example bot model.

You will need a Microsoft™ Azure account which you can get [here](https://azure.microsoft.com).

To begin, go to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in to your account.

Select _Bot services_.


Select _Add_ and then _Web App Bot_.

Fill in the name of the new bot, which must be as yet unregistered, and fill in the other values.
Choose Echo bot as the type.

After a short period your Bot connection will be created.

You can test this primitive bot just to make sure everything is working.
Note two things are created: a bot service and a web app, both with the same name.

Now let's create our own bot to overwrite this.

go to [GitHub](https://github.com/drandysip/DarlCoreBot) and download a copy of the DARL bot.

We'll assume you are using Visual Studio.

Load the solution, compile and publish it.

Choose the web app you created previously.

Once the bot is published we just have to change it's settings.

Back in the azure portal navigate to the Web app and edit the settings.

![Edit settings 1](/images/tutorial6.png)

There are four settings you need to add. They are

- "DarlAPIAddress", this is always: "https://darl.dev/graphql/"
- "DarlBotModel", this is the name of your model, such as "thousandquestions.model"
- "initialText", This is the first text the bot shows given a new connection, such as "hello from darlbot".
- "DarlAPIKey", This is the API key to access your account on Darl.dev. Find it by logging into Darl.Dev and then making the following query:

```json
{
  getApiKey
}

```

When the settings are complete you should see the following:

Select _Save_ to save the changes.

Now, if you've done this correctly, you can navigate back to the bot service and test it.

In order to use this bot in anger you need to connect it to various other channels, such as Skype or Facebook Messenger. This process is described in the Microsoft [bot framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).
