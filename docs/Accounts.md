Accounts
======

Accounts are of two kinds: individual and corporate.

Only your Active Directory account administrator can sign your organization up to corporate accounts.

# Trial period
You can use the system free for 30 days. Thereafter your account will be suspended unless you upgrade to a paid account.

# Billing
You will be billed monthly via email for license and any usage charges. The email will contain links to pay the outstanding sum.

# Suspension

If you don't pay within 14 days, or your trial has expired without you registering,  your account will be suspended. You will still be able to log in, but you will not be able to save model changes.

The top bar will contain a lock symbol to indicate your account is suspended.

Registering, if at the end of a trial, or paying your bill will result in the suspension being lifted at the end of the next back office processing cycle. This is typically half an hour.

# Bot Suspension
If an account is suspended, we reserve the right to switch your bot models for our own models indicating the account is suspended. Your bot models will be reinstated at the end of the next back office processing cycle.

# Changes to this system
We reserve the right to change this system, how we bill and our terms in the future.
